            <p>Instagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. Users can add a caption to each of their posts 
                and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index these posts and make them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a 
                user appears on their followers' Instagram feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users also 
                have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.</p>
